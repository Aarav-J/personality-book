<h1>Personality Boook</h1>
<h3>I based this test on the Big 5 personalit test</h3>
<h2>Here are the 5 categories</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Extraversion - measure of how sociable, outgoing, and energetic an individual is</li> 
  <li>Agreeableness -  individualâ€™s tendencies with respect to social harmony </li>
  <li>Conscientiousness - how careful, deliberate, self-disciplined, and organized an individual is.</li>
  <li>Neuroticism - measures the ways in which individuals react to stress.</li>
  <li>Openness - measures the extent to which an individual is imaginative and creative, as opposed to down-to-earth and conventional.</li>
 </ul>
